		The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">
		Regular Expression</a> Database (REDB) hosts <i><a href="#task">tasks</a></i>
		and their solutions. Tasks are anonymously submitted, and
		the solutions are anonymously collected via the <a href="#regex">
		ReGeX game server protocol</a>.
	    </p>

	    <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

	    <h4 id="task">What is a task?</h4>
	    <p>
		A task is, simply put, a set of words (or more generally character
		sequences), some of which have to be matched, others intentionally
		not. Matching is done by means of regular expressions.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		Furthermore the followig metadata is stored:
		<dl>
		    <dt>Title</dt>
		    <dd>A short name, explaining what this task is about</dd>
		    <dt>Author</dt>
		    <dd>
			A non-verified reference to who created the task. Should
			oblige to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.4">
			RFC 5322</a>
		    </dd>
		    <dt>Description</dt>
		    <dd>
			A more elaborate, but not necessary, text on the task.
			It might point out what is special about the challenge,
			or what the client should pay attention to when trying
			to solve it.
		    </dd>
		    <dt>Times called</dt>
		    <dd>
			This number describes the ammount of times this challenge
			has been offered to a client, but not the ammount of times
			is has been solved successfully.
		    </dd>
		    <dt>When created</dt>
		    <dd>The date and time refering to when the task was created.</dd>
		</dl>
	    </p>

	    <h4 id="contrib">How to contribute?</h4>
	    <p>
		There are 3 major ways to contribute to REDB:
		<ol>
		    <li>
			By creating interesting and challenging tasks,
			you improve the quality of the database. To do
			so, <a href="/contrib">visit this page</a>, and
			fill in the form. If you wish to contribute
			in bulk, send an email to <a href="mailto:bluk@{{ $domain }}">
			bulk@{{ $domain }}</a>. Details will be discussed individually.
		    </li>
		    <li>
			Development is always welcome, especially
			when trying to improve software quality, speed
			or safely. Development is centered on
			<a href="http:github.com/phikal/redb">GitHub</a>,
			but may not necessarily stay there forever. Patches
			are also accepted via <a href="mailto:patches@{{ $domain }}">
			    patch@{{ $domain }}</a>
		    </li>
		    <li>
			Some tasks might be considered <i>unfit</i> for
			public use. Reasons might be anything from pure
			lack of challenge (match: "ab", "ac"; don't match: "xzy"),
			up to inappropriate content or private/sensitive data
			embedded into a challenge (later on, a NSFW filter might
			be added, to compromise between quality and censorship).
			<br/>If for whatever reason you feel like a task should
			be removed (or later on hidden), send an email with an explanation,
			and the ID to <a href="mailto:report@{{ $domain }}">report@{{ $domain }}</a>.
		    </li>
		</ol>

	    <h5>Owners and Maintainers</h5>
	    <p>
		Currently this server was initially developed and is currently
		maintained by <a href="http://phikal.ignorelist.com">Philip
		Kaludercic</a>. 
	    </p>

	    <h5>Contact and Updates</h5>
	    <p>
		The only relaible contact is either via <a href="mailto:contact@{{ $domain }}">
		email</a>. Occasional updates would be posted on
		<a href="https://quitter.no/redb">GNU Status</a>.
	    </p>

	    <h5>On accounts</h5>
	    <p>
		REDB does on purpose not enforce, nor even offer accounts. Submission
		is done anonymously, meaning that any data on the author doesn't
		necessary indicate that that person created the task (later on
		PGP auth might be added, to certify tasks).
	    </p>

	    <h5>On the domain</h5>
	    <p>
		The domain <code>{{ $domain }}</code>, has no direct affilication
		to the United Kingdom, but was rather chosen by chance, since
		all other reputable top-level domain names were not
		available.
	    </p>

	    <h5>What is a regular expression?</h5>
	    <blockquote cite="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html">
		Regular expressions are a notation for describing sets
		of character strings. When a particular string is in
		the set described by a regular expression, we often
		say that the regular expression matches the string.
	    </blockquote>
	    
	    <h2 id="tech">Technical</h2>
	    <p>
		This server, and all components immediately connected to it,
		are implemented in <a href="http://golang.org">
		the Go programming language</a>. The database used is PostgreSQL.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		The source is available for free use under GPL,
		The README file has all the instructions and
		information neccesary to start working.
	    </p>

	    <h2 id="regex">REDB as a ReGeX game server</h2>
	    <p>
		A ReGeX game server creates or offers <i>challenges</i>
		(ie. certain words to match and certain words not to),
		which may be solved by the participant.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		It is up the the server to decide what to do with
		the result. The client isn't even guaranteed wether
		the server will check the suggestions validity.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		REDB, which has a ReGeX game server tightly integrated
		into itself, <b>will save the suggestion</b>, and
		grant penalties on those who abuse it. These results
		are all public, and no metadata (besides when it was
		submitted) is saved.
	    </p>
	    <p>
		On *nix systems, one could play without installing
		any further programmes (but <code>nc</code> or similar),
		as so:
	    </p>
	    <code>nc {{ $domain }} 25921</code>
	    <p>
		The protocol is specified in the <a href="https://github.com/phikal/REDB/blob/master/game.go">
		source code</a>, and could (or should) also easily be
		parsed by a client programme.</p>
